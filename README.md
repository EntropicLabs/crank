# Kujira BOW Crank

The BOW market making protocol on Kujira requires the individual contracts to be "cranked", to adjust their orders in response to some of them being filled.

Long-term this will be replaced by the on-chain scheduler. Until then, this app allows us to understand the dynamics of these crankers before committing to the scheduler.
